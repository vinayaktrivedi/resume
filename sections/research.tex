    \begin{cvitems}
    \item Research Project on developing a Generic sandbox for any application which is transparent to the end-user, by using an interface to split VFS syscalls for Host files and Socket based system calls for X server.
    \item Established the Security Guarantee and Threat Model of the system. Designed architecture, and implemented a generic 'three-way' efficient Communication channel between VM and Host, to transfer syscalls information from one side to the other. 
    \item Implemented the Kernel Module code for interception and Split-Handling of various critical syscalls like \textbf{Select, Poll, Fcntl, Ioctl, Mmap, Writev, Dup, Recvmsg.} 
    \item Worked on unit-testing and Benchmarking framework for both GUI and non-GUI applications, by simulating User Keyboard and Mouse events behaviour through Uinput.
    \item Successfully tested applications \textbf{Wget, SSH, Scp, Sftp, elinks, Pdfviewer, Gedit and Thunderbird} to be running in this Quarentined Architecture with almost-local-like Performance and CPU Usage.
