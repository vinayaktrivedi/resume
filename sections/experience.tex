      \item Worked on a generic Profiler in python, to pin-point Java Threads blocking CPU/IO/Network in a system on Spike, by concurrently using Jstack and top utility. Devised a multi-variable scoring system for threads to reduce false-positives, after a series of observations.
      \item	Currently in Production and helped bring down the CPU usage from \textbf{90\% during Spike to 50\%} by pointing out the inefficient code blocks. 
      \item Implemented a Mongo based Cache for metadata of Logs stored in S3, to reduce the Query time of Spark. Reduced the initial Response time of \textbf{120 seconds to 3 seconds}.

      \item Implemented a Redis-based Cache, after performing benchmarking of in-memory Databases namely Aerospike, Memcached and Redis, to Cache the common Database queries. Performed Load-testing of the Cache framework and devised an Adaptive strategy for TTL of the Cache based on access patterns of the Table.
      \item Achieved about \textbf{50 percent drop} in Database queries of tables cached, and \textbf{25
percent drop} in response-time.
