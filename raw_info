NetSandbox (3 points - 6-7 Lines Total) - 1.5 years Working
1. Research Project on developing a Generic sandbox for any application, and restricting all attacks from entering the host system, using an interface to split VFS and Socket based system calls. By intercepting VFS syscalls for files stored in host, and socket syscalls for X server, an application runs inside a VM, pretending as if it is running inside the Host machine. 
2. Established the various Security Guarantees and Threat Model of this system. Designed the overall architecture, and implemented a 'three-way' efficient Communication channel between VM and Host, to transfer syscalls information from one side to the other. 
3. Implemented the system code for interception of various critical syscalls like SELECT, POLL, FCTNL, IOCTL, MMAP, WRITEV, DUP, RECVMSG etc. 
4. Worked on unit-testing and Benchmarking framework for the system, for both GUI and non-GUI applications.
5. Successfully tested various renowned applications like Wget, SSH, Scp, Sftp, Pdfviewer, Gedit, Thunderbird to be running in this Quarentined Architecture, and achieved near-to-local Performance numbers.

--Work
1. PharmEasy (3 Lines)
--> Implemented a Redis-based Cache, after performing benchmarking of in-memory Databases namely Aerospike, Memcached and Redis, to Cache the common Database queries. Performed Load-testing of the Cache framework and devised an Adaptive strategy for TTL.
--> Achieved about 50 percent drop in Database queries of tables cached, and 25
percent drop in response-time.

2. Sprinklr - (5-6 Lines)
--> Worked on Writing a generic Profiler in python, to pin-point Java Threads blocking CPU/IO/Network inside a system on Spike, by using the Jstack and top utility. Devised a multi-variable scoring system to extract the 'real' resource-consuming threads after taking series of observations.
--> Currently used in Production and helped bring down the CPU usage from 90% during Spike to 50% by pointing out the inefficient code blocks. 
--> Implemented a Mongo based Cache for the metadata of Logs stored in S3, to reduce the Query time of Apache Spark for particular log files. Reduced the initial Response time of 120 seconds to 3 seconds.
